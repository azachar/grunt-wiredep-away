grunt-wiredep-away
==================
*Inject ~~Bower~~ npm packages into your source code with Grunt.*

# Objective
Simplify the migration of bower to npm.

To do this I forked from [grunt-wiredep](https://github.com/stephenplusplus/grunt-wiredep) and changed the
dependencie of [wiredep](https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep) to
[azachar/wiredep-away](https://github.com/azachar/wiredep-away).

# Configuration
